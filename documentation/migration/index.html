    <h1>Migrations</h1>

    <p>Flyway updates the database from one version to the next using <strong>migrations</strong>.</p>

    <p>Migrations can either be <strong>versioned</strong> or <strong>repeatable</strong>. Versioned migrations have
        a unique version and are applied exactly once. Repeatable migrations do not have a version. Instead they are
        (re-)applied
        every time their checksum changes.</p>

    <p>Within a single migration run, repeatable migrations are always applied last, after all pending versioned migrations have been executed. Repeatable migrations are applied in the order of their description.</p>

    <p>Both versioned and repeatable migrations can be written either in <strong><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/migration/sql">sql</a></strong>
        or in <strong><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/migration/java">java</a></strong> and can consist of multiple statements.</p>

    <p>Within a single migration, all statements are run within a single transaction.</p>

    <h2>Metadata table</h2>

    <p>To keep track of which migrations have already been applied when and by whom, Flyway adds a special bookkeeping
        table to your schema. This <strong>metadata table</strong> also tracks migration checksums and whether or not
        the migrations were successful.</p>

    <p>Read more about this in our getting started guide on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/getstarted/how">how Flyway works</a>.</p>

    <h2>Migration States</h2>

    <p>
        Migrations are either <em>resolved</em> or <em>applied</em>. Resolved migrations have been detected by Flyway's
        filesystem
        and classpath scanner. Initially they are <strong>pending</strong>. Once they are executed against the database,
        they become applied.
    </p>

    <p>All statements of a migration are run within a single transaction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the migration <em>succeeds</em> it is marked as <strong>success</strong> in Flyway's <em>metadata
            table</em>.
        </li>
        <li>When the migration <em>fails</em> and the database supports <em>DDL transactions</em>, the migration is <em>rolled
            back</em> and nothing is recorded in the metadata table.
        </li>
        <li>When the migration <em>fails</em> and the database doesn't supports <em>DDL transactions</em>, the migration
            is marked as <strong>failed</strong> in the metadata table, indicating manual database cleanup may be
            required.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Repeatable migrations whose checksum has changed since they are last applied are <strong>outdated</strong> until
        they are executed again.</p>

    <p>When Flyway discovers an applied versioned migration with a version that is higher than the highest known version
        (this happens typically when a newer version of the software has migrated that schema), that migration is marked as <strong>future</strong>.</p>
