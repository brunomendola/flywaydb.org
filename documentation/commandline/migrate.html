                This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
                strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this
                provides a way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean
                automatically, ensuring that the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into
                SCM.<br/><br/><strong>Warning ! Do not enable in production !</strong>
