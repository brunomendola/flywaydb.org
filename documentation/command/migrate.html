    <h1>Migrate</h1>

    <p>Migrates the schema to the latest version. Flyway will create the metadata table automatically if it doesn't exist.</p>

    <p>Migrate is the centerpiece of the Flyway workflow. It will scan the filesystem or your classpath for available migrations.
    It will compare them to the migrations that have been applied to the database. If any difference is found, it will
    migrate the database to close the gap.</p>

    <p>Migrate should preferably be executed on application startup to avoid any incompatibilities between the database
        and the expectations of the code.</p>

    <h3>Example 1: We have migrations available up to version 9, and the database is at version 5.</h3>

    <p>Migrate will apply the migrations 6, 7, 8 and 9 in order.</p>

    <h3>Example 2: We have migrations available up to version 9, and the database is at version 9.</h3>

    <p>Migrate does nothing.</p>
